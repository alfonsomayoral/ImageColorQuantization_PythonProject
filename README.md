## **ðŸ“– Overview**
This project explores the application of the K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data clustering and dimensionality reduction. A specific focus is placed on **image color quantization**, where K-means is utilized to simplify the number of colors in an image, improving compression and providing artistic rendering effects.

The implementation is structured in a clear and modular Jupyter Notebook, enabling seamless experimentation and visualization. This project showcases the application of **K-means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for the following tasks:

1. **Synthetic Dataset Clustering**: Using K-means to group data points into clusters and visualizing the cluster assignments and centroids for different \(K\) values.

2. **Evaluating K-means Performance**: Analyzing the impact of the number of clusters using the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and determining the optimal number of clusters using the "elbow method."

3. **Image Color Quantization**: Applying K-means to simplify the color palette of an image and visualizing the transformation for multiple \(K\) values.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Reducing the RGB space of an image to 2D and investigating how PCA affects the clustering and quantization results.

### ðŸš€ **Introduction**
The project leverages **unsupervised machine learning techniques**:
1. **K-means clustering**: Partitioning data into clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing data dimensionality while retaining key variance.

This notebook demonstrates their integration for tasks like:
- Clustering synthetic datasets.
- Image compression and artistic transformation via color quantization.
- Dimensionality reduction for enhancing clustering performance.

### ðŸ“Œ **How to Use**

_Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine._

1. Clone the repository and install the required libraries.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project_directory
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install Required Dependencies
- Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Install the necessary libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
- This will install dependencies such as: NumPy for numerical computations, Scikit-learn for implementing K-means and PCA, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, scikit-image for image processing.

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook
- Run the following command to open the Jupyter Notebook interface:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Color_Quatization_Using_Kmeans_Clustering.ipynb
- This will open the notebook in your default web browser.

4. Navigate Through the Notebook
- The notebook is structured into sections. Start by running the initial cells to set up the environment and import the required libraries.
- Each section includes explanations and visualizations. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.

5. Test with Your Own Image
- To test the color quantization on your own image:
   1. Save your image file as photo.JPG.
   2. Place the image in the same directory as the notebook.
 
6. Experiment with Parameters
- Feel free to tweak parameters like:
   - Number of clusters (K): Modify the K values in the K-means clustering sections to see how the results change.
   - Image dimensions: Resize the image for faster processing or better results.
 
7.  Save the Outputs
- You can save the quantized images or plots generated during the execution by using the following commands:
   ```bash
   plt.savefig('output_image_name.png', dpi=300)

8. Troubleshooting
- If any library is missing, install it manually using:
   ```bash
   pip install <library_name>.
- Ensure that photo.JPG is correctly named and in the notebookâ€™s directory.

**With these steps, you can fully explore and experiment with the project. Happy coding! ðŸš€**

#### **2. Image Color Quantization (Original vs Quantized Images)**
The original image was quantized using K-means clustering for different values of \( K \). Below are comparisons for \( K = 4 \) and \( K = 16 \).

#### **3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**
The RGB pixel data of the image was reduced to 2D using PCA, visualized as a scatter plot. This reduced representation was then clustered using K-means, and the results were mapped back to the original RGB space.
