# ImageColorQuantization_PythonProject
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data clustering and dimensionality reduction. We also apply these techniques to image color quantization, where K-means is used to simplify the number of colors in an image. This process can be useful for compression and artistic rendering of images.
